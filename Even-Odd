What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

 Big-O :  O(1)
 Reason: This is basic arithmetic operation and no matter the size
 of the input only one or two operations take place
